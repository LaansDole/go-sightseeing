Business Rule: Negative Balance Prediction for Cancellation

Scenario:
The user requests to cancel their subscription, and the system must predict the account balance after applying the expected service payments for the remaining period.

Business Rule:
- Before finalizing the cancellation, the system should perform a predictive calculation to determine what the account balance will be after deducting any remaining service fees.
- If this predicted balance is negative, the cancellation request is invalid, and the user must be notified.
- The user's current balance remains unchanged until they proceed with resolving the active services or settling any outstanding amount.
- The system should:
  - Notify the user that cancellation is currently not possible due to a predicted negative balance.
  - Suggest actions the user can take to resolve the issue (e.g., paying off the expected service charges, adjusting or canceling specific services).
  - Block the cancellation until the predicted negative balance is resolved or the services are adjusted.

Implementation:
- The system should have a method to predict the post-cancellation balance by considering all active services and fees.
- If the predicted balance is negative, the cancellation process should be halted, and the user should be informed of the issue.
